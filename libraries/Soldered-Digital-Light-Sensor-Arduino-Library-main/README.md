For very precise measurements of the amount of light, take this digital light sensor into account (ALS - Ambient Light Sensor). In addition, the LTR-507ALS also measures the proximity (PS - Proximity Sensor) of the object to the sensor. It sends all this data via I2C communication, which is easy to read via our Arduino library.

- IC: LTR-507ALS
- Communication: I2C
- easyC connector: 2 pieces
- Dimensions: 38 x 22 mm (https://www.soldered.com/en/easyC)
